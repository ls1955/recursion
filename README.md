# Recursion

This repo is part of [TOP's project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion) which consists of two methods.

## Warm up: Fibonacci

#### Method description:
Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
This method will be rewrite in recursively manner later on.

## Merge Sort

#### Method description:
Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
